It also mentions that Jupiter has many co-orbital objects, referred to as \"Jovian trojans\". Additionally, it discusses other small co-orbital moons in the Saturnian system, specifically naming Telesto, Calypso, Tethys, Helene, and Polydeuces.\n\n3. **Determine Relationships**:\n   - Mars is compared to Jupiter in terms of their co-orbital objects.\n   - 5261 Eureka is identified as a co-orbital asteroid of Mars.\n   - Telesto and Calypso are mentioned as co-orbital moons related to Tethys.\n   - Helene and Polydeuces are mentioned as co-orbital moons related to Dione (not listed as an entity).\n\n4. **Extract Relations**:\n   - (Mars, 5261 Eureka, Part of) - since 5261 Eureka is a co-orbital asteroid of Mars.\n   - (Mars, Jupiter, Compare) - since both are compared in terms of their co-orbital objects.\n   - (Telesto, Calypso, Related to) - since they are mentioned together in the context of co-orbital moons with Tethys.\n   - (Tethys, Helene, Related to) - since Helene is mentioned with Polydeuces in relation to Dione.\n\n5. **Compile Results**: Based on the analysis, the identified relationships are:\n   - (Mars, 5261 Eureka, Part of)\n   - (Mars, Jupiter, Compare)\n   - (Telesto, Calypso, Related to)\n   - (Tethys, Helene, Related to)\n   - (Tethys, Polydeuces, Related to)",
